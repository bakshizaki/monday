This software was developed along with eGuru to help instructors easily generate question files required in eGuru.  

It has two modes.  
1. Defining FBD:  
   Here instructors can define an FBD by first defining FBD cuts and then selecting a valid FBD cut. This data can be later saved to a file to be loaded into eGuru.

2. Defining Forces:
	In this mode instructors can load an image and define correct forces on force points. A toolbox is provided on the side to select different types of forces and moments. After defining these, all the data can be then saved to a file to be loaded into eGuru.
